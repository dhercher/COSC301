The code runs up to fork.  After the fork, the parent process continues until it is done, printing:
	Who are you? 150 \n
After the parent process is done, the child continues from the fork with pid = 0.This then prints:
	Or am I? 50

The variable buffer is not declared on the heap, and there is no way to return local memory since it will be deleted.
We need to use malloc with buffer, so the declaration for buffer becomes:
    char *buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) * (strlen(s) + 1));
